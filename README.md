color-sudoku
============

Each cell is colored dynamically, based on the number of filled in cells in its row (red), column (blue) and quadrant (green). This gives each sudoku a unique color pattern. Also whenever a number is added, the colors change accordingly. So when there are no more valid options, everything is white and you have completed the sudoku.
